## This is a learning dataset from Kaggle
#### "Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc.

#### He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.

#### Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.

#### In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is"
#### I made two machine learning models to predict the price range which was encoded in 0 1 2 3 as a target variable, a Logistic regression and an Artificial Neural Network with accuracy of 98% and 97%
